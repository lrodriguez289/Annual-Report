    <h1>Sustainability</h1>
    <img src="img/sus.jpg">
    <p>Our company’s purpose is to be the world’s most trusted energy partner. This year we will publish our 25th annual sustainability report, demonstrating our longstanding commitment to sustainability and the value we believe it creates for all of our stakeholders. Sustainability starts at the top of our company and is reinforced at every level. Our Board of Directors is climate change literate and actively engaged in overseeing Hess’ environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS  & SR) practices, working alongside senior management.<p>

    <h2>SAFETY AND HEALTH</h2>
    <p>   Hess’ safety programs and practices aim to maintain a culture in which employees and contractors keep each other safe on the job and work together to continuously improve our performance. In 2021, our multidisciplinary emergency response team continued to oversee our pandemic response, which was highly effective in reducing the risks of COVID-19 in our workplace and ensuring business continuity.

   In 2021, we achieved a 9% reduction in our workforce total recordable incident rate (TRIR) from 2020, driven by a year over year decrease in our employee TRIR. We reached a six year low in our severe and significant safety incident rate, achieving a 14% reduction from 2020. We continue to improve our process safety performance and between 2016 and 2021 have reduced the number of Tier 1 process safety incidents by 60% based on our current portfolio of operated assets. The safety performance of our contractors, who represent approximately 70% of our total workforce hours, is critical to achieving our safety goals. In 2021, we successfully completed a number of operational milestones in which contractor engagement was vital to our strong safety performance. These included onboarding two drilling rigs in the Bakken and one in North Malay Basin and completion of the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround – all with zero recordable safety incidents.</p>

    <h2>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
    <P>   As part of our company’s commitment to social responsibility we participate in multistakeholder initiatives designed to advance transparency, environmental protection, human rights and good governance. For example, we are a member of IPIECA, 10 2021 ANNUAL REPORTthe global oil and gas industry organization for environmental and social issues, as well as the U.N. Global Compact and the Global Compact U.S. Network, which share best practices in sustainable business conduct across the private sector. 

   In keeping with our company values and purpose, we have a longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplace and through social investment programs that make a positive and lasting impact on the communities where we operate. In 2021, we announced a $1.4 million grant to the Jackie Robinson Foundation to provide four year scholarships and internship opportunities to underrepresented college students and to support the new Jackie Robinson Museum that will serve as a venue for educational programming.</P>

<section class="disclosure">
    <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERANCE (ESG) DISCLOSURE</h2>
    <p>   We see transparency in reporting as an important part  of being a trusted energy partner. Our reporting aligns  with a number of frameworks, including oil and gas industry metrics from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  and TCFD recommendations. Our sustainability report is prepared in accordance with the Core option of the Global Reporting Initiative Standards. Details of our EHS & SR strategy and performance, including how our plans and actions support the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals,  are discussed in our sustainability report, available at  www.hess.com/sustainability. 

   In 2021, we continued to be recognized for the quality of  our ESG performance and disclosure. For example, we achieved leadership status in the CDP’s annual Global Climate Analysis for the 13th consecutive year and earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 12th consecutive year. After receiving an MSCI ESG rating of AA for 10 consecutive years, Hess’  rating was upgraded to AAA in 2021 to signify our industry leadership. The Transition Pathway Initiative, which independently assesses companies on their efforts to support the transition to a low carbon economy and  mitigate climate change in line with TCFD recommendations, rated Hess as top Level 4 status in its November 2021 report. </p>
